## Ahmed's Horiseon Update 

The goal of this assignment was to make an existing website more accesible by refactoring existing Code. 

#### Refactoring Changes

These steps were taken to enhance the clarity and accessibility of the website for consumers and assistive technolies:

- Used this website to get examples of semantic elements: [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- Replaced divs with "header" and "nav"
- Replaced div that consisted of class of content with "main"
- Created service sections
- Replaced benefits with "aside" and each benefit had its own class
- Replaced div class=footer to just "footer"
